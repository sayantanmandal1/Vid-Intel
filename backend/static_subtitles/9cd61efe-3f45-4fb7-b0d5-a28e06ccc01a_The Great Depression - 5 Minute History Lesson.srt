1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,799
In the world of finance, we are often quick to forget the tragedies of the past, yet valuable

2
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:08,359
lessons are to be had by exploring their causes and effects.

3
00:00:08,359 --> 00:00:12,700
After all, in the world of ever changing rules, products, and services, history is the

4
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:15,839
one constant that can guide us through the ambiguity.

5
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:21,480
So let's take a five minute history lesson on today's plane bagel.

6
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:25,640
The year is 1918, and after four years of conflict, the First World War is finally over.

7
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:29,240
America has emerged as one of the victors, and is both entered a period of economic prosperity

8
00:00:29,239 --> 00:00:32,159
and cultural change known as the Roaring 20s.

9
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:35,199
Things start off pretty strongly, as the postal economy is seeing a boost.

10
00:00:35,199 --> 00:00:38,439
Troops are back from the war, delayed projects are spending up again, and hey, more women

11
00:00:38,439 --> 00:00:41,560
are entering the workforce, meaning that more people have a salary to spend.

12
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:43,719
And companies are looking for a piece of the money pie.

13
00:00:43,719 --> 00:00:46,399
So in 1920, we see our first radio advertisement.

14
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:47,759
And it seems to be working.

15
00:00:47,759 --> 00:00:50,480
Recent inventions like the back and cleaner and the electric wash machine are becoming

16
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:51,480
hot commodities.

17
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:54,799
And hey, since things are looking pretty good, the banks are giving out loans to everybody,

18
00:00:54,799 --> 00:00:57,599
meaning that even more people can buy the latest and greatest gadgets.

19
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,280
Or you know what, everyone's getting a car too.

20
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,320
Henry Ford's team model to be exact, and with it, life is becoming a lot easier.

21
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:05,920
Now you can do the Charleston and Cross Town, be home for your evening smoke.

22
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,519
All of this is making companies very rich.

23
00:01:07,519 --> 00:01:09,799
And the average American is making good money themselves.

24
00:01:09,799 --> 00:01:12,879
In fact, people are starting to look for things to do with their newfound wealth.

25
00:01:12,879 --> 00:01:13,879
Buy another laundry machine?

26
00:01:13,879 --> 00:01:15,480
Nah, a new car, don't eat it.

27
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:17,079
Oh, wait, what about investing?

28
00:01:17,079 --> 00:01:18,079
Yeah, that's it.

29
00:01:18,079 --> 00:01:20,560
After all, why be rich when you can be more French?

30
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,879
So the stock market becomes a pretty popular practice.

31
00:01:22,879 --> 00:01:26,840
And with so many people buying, investors are finding it very easy to make money on stocks.

32
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:29,120
Soon enough, everyone thinks they're 1920s Warren Buffett.

33
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:30,520
And I mean everybody.

34
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:33,760
Cooks, shoe shines, tax drivers, you name it, everyone is trading like a Wall Street

35
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:37,120
tycoon, pouring their life savings into whatever security is hot that day.

36
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:40,719
In fact, there's so much money to be made, people are taking out loans to invest even more.

37
00:01:40,719 --> 00:01:42,560
And banks are probably collecting the interest.

38
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,159
By the way, those same banks are looking to invest more money too.

39
00:01:45,159 --> 00:01:49,840
And soon enough, they begin borrowing money from customer bank accounts to buy stocks.

40
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,960
But since things are looking up, no one's noticing.

41
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:54,840
And overall, things are going pretty well in America financially anyway.

42
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:58,359
And as we experience flapper culture, prohibition and derives of jazz music, people are making

43
00:01:58,359 --> 00:01:59,640
good money on the markets.

44
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:04,719
By 1929, America's total wealth has doubled and investments are up 218% since 1922.

45
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:07,700
In fact, stocks are rising so fast, companies are having a hard time keeping up and just

46
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:09,039
finding their stock price.

47
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:10,400
Wait, that's not good.

48
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,920
And hold on, production actually seems to be slowing down.

49
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:16,319
Henry's not making as many team models and people aren't buying as many things.

50
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:19,960
It looks like companies may have overestimated their growth and now wages are falling.

51
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,319
And all that easy tax is dead.

52
00:02:21,319 --> 00:02:25,599
Well, people have taken out quite a bit and, uh oh, interest rates are starting to rise.

53
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:27,840
But wait a minute, the stock market is still up.

54
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,120
That doesn't see right?

55
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:32,079
Even though the economy is looking worse for wear under the hood, investors are more

56
00:02:32,079 --> 00:02:35,439
less ignoring these problems and buying something as if everything were exceptional.

57
00:02:35,439 --> 00:02:39,719
Sure, we see a few shakeups in close calls, but things are still largely positive and people

58
00:02:39,719 --> 00:02:41,439
are still gambling on the markets.

59
00:02:41,439 --> 00:02:43,719
But over time, the voice of reason is getting louder.

60
00:02:43,719 --> 00:02:48,479
And investor uncertainty is increasing, which brings us to October 24th, 1929.

61
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:52,599
Black Thursday, as it's called, the theorized start of the Great Depression.

62
00:02:52,599 --> 00:02:57,199
Investors have been royally spooked with headlines reading, and when markets open, they start

63
00:02:57,199 --> 00:02:58,199
to sell.

64
00:02:58,199 --> 00:02:59,199
And I mean sell.

65
00:02:59,199 --> 00:03:01,280
12.9 million shares to be exact.

66
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,280
A new record.

67
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,679
And at opening bell, things fall 11%.

68
00:03:04,679 --> 00:03:07,159
People are selling so much that price stickers can't keep up with the volume.

69
00:03:07,159 --> 00:03:09,560
So people don't even know what they're selling prices.

70
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:13,039
And all of this selling is dragging the stock market down, and raising large chunks of America's

71
00:03:13,039 --> 00:03:14,039
wealth.

72
00:03:14,039 --> 00:03:15,519
And things are about to get worse.

73
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:19,120
While markets recover later that day, come Black Tuesday, it's an outright panic.

74
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,800
The Dow Jones falls 12%.

75
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,080
And at record, we set last Thursday, yeah, we just broke it again.

76
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,719
The markets lose $14 billion in one day.

77
00:03:26,719 --> 00:03:27,960
Some shares are now worthless.

78
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:32,400
People have lost their life savings in Americans who borrow to invest our absolutely crushed.

79
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,520
And so, friends, here we are.

80
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:39,120
The Great Depression, the worst economic downturn in the history of the industrialized world.

81
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:42,640
The Dow Jones falls for another three years after this, losing 90% of its value from its

82
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,160
high in 1929.

83
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:46,159
And they lose their jobs as companies shut down.

84
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:47,919
And it's not just investors that are hit.

85
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:49,240
Remember that money the banks borrowed?

86
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:51,240
Well, a bunch of it is lost and the market's too.

87
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:54,759
And people are only getting back $0.10 for every dollar they had in their account.

88
00:03:54,759 --> 00:04:01,560
Banks across the country shut down, and unemployment reaches its highest level in US history, 24.9%.

89
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:05,280
By this point, red lines, suit kitchens, and homelessness are common sites.

90
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,439
Whether you invested, borrowed money, or even just held money in a bank account, the

91
00:04:08,439 --> 00:04:10,879
depression found a way to hurt you financially.

92
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:12,879
Times would be tough throughout the 1930s.

93
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:16,279
And physical intervention from Franklin D. Roosevelt would do little to boost activity.

94
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:19,800
In fact, it wouldn't be until the rise of the third Reich in Germany that we would

95
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:20,800
see end to the crisis.

96
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:23,680
You see, the Great Depression wasn't just felt in America.

97
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:27,240
Rather with recent globalization, its effects were felt around the world.

98
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:31,360
And in the darkness, we saw the rise of Hitler, who used the despair of the German people

99
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,360
as a rallying call.

100
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:36,199
Ultimately, leading to the creation of the Nazi Party and the start of the Second World

101
00:04:36,199 --> 00:04:37,920
War in 1939.

102
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:42,640
The war created jobs in America, ironically ending one tragedy with the start of another.

103
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:46,360
Experts can't agree on why the Great Depression was as bad as it was, but the war valuable

104
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,840
takeaways from the hardship.

105
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:51,520
It demonstrated just how powerful the greed and alternatively the fear of the markets

106
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:56,040
can be when they get out of control, while demonstrating the destructive potential of speculation

107
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,120
and debt.

108
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:00,520
Laws would later be introduced to safeguard financial institutions and deposits.

109
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:04,120
Injuring this time in office, Franklin D. Roosevelt would introduce the Federal Deposit Insurance

110
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:07,280
Corporation and the Securities Exchange Commission.

111
00:05:07,279 --> 00:05:11,039
He was targeted at protecting the wealth of Americans that still exists to this day.

112
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:14,279
Few are left to remember the hardships of the Depression, but we'd be foolish to forget

113
00:05:14,279 --> 00:05:15,759
the lessons it provided.

114
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:35,799
After all, fear, greed and speculation are far from dead.
